Problem Statement
Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement wildcard pattern matching with support for '?' and '*' where:

'?' Matches any single character.
'*' Matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence).
The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "aa", p = "a"
Output: false
Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".
