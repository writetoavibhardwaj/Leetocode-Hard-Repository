Q) You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

First thoughts:
1) Linked List: No looping possible. Only adjacent elements can be accessed.
2) Full scans O(Nk) are impractical 
3) We can not predict TLE friendly merges beforehand due to lack of traversal.


The Method:
1) Divide and conquer :Pair linked lists. Merge them 2 at a time . Next  merge these lists pairwise.

Say list1 = a0->a1->(?...) length l1
    list2 = b0->b1->(?...) length l2
and so on 
(?) since it requires step by step traversal which we have not done yet 
So we push them into heap and then push the cursor 1 step ahead


So we now have
heap=[a0,b0...]
list1 = a1->a2->(?...) length l1-1
list2 = b1->b2->(?...) length l2-1
