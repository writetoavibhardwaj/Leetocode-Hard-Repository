# LeetCode Hard Problems – Detailed Explanations & Solutions

This repository contains my personal deep-dive solutions to selected **LeetCode Hard** problems.  
For each problem, I include:

- **Problem summary** (in my own words)
- **Step-by-step approach**
- **Complexity analysis**
- **Clean, well-commented code** in Python
- Additional notes on pitfalls and alternative methods

**Why this repo?**  
To demonstrate not just the ability to solve hard algorithmic problems, but to **explain them clearly** — an essential skill for interviews and real-world problem solving.
