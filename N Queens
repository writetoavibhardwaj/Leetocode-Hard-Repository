Accidentally Pasted it in Issues section.Repasting it here.
The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle. You may return the answer in any order.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively.

-First Thoughts

-Backtracking heavy

have to compute ALL correct scenarios
-Correct combinations can not be pre known until last queen finds correct
-Size of board is small 1 <= n <= 9 so no TLE issues

Row/column/diagonal relationship

Row - column equivalent ish

traverse on basis of columns
-A queen moves diagonally as well as along straight lines

Once square occupied corresponding straight lines and diagonals (2 diagonals) are not free

Constraints reset for next setup
-if correct configuration mention the setup else move on
